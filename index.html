        <h1>Analysis Paper</h1>

        <p>Throughout history, it’s known for people to see and view the world differently. This concept stems from individual
            culture and the area you grew up in. There’s no exception for Indigenous people and how the world views them.
            The first example that shows the difference between Native Americans and Western religious practices is in the
            film In the Light of Reverence. For example, being in the Native culture, they believe that the Blackhill is the
            center of life. A quote from the film, that represents this idea is “The idea is not to pretend to own it or
            not to exploit it but respect it. Trying to get people to see that there's a dimension of religion is really
            difficult” (McLeod and Maynor). This is an example that shows the difference between how Western people view
            religion. For example, people follow the bible but don’t tend to really respect it on a spiritual level. An
            example from the film that shows how the natives connect with their religion on a spiritual level is this group
            called the Lakota runners. </p>

        <p>
            The Lakota runners circle the black hills in 5 days, which are around 500 miles in length. Why they run is 
            “to renew their spiritual claim to the land they never gave up”(McLeod and Maynor). One of the important sites,
            while Native people do this run is called the lodge of the bear or Mato Tipila where they believe, is where life
            comes back and was also created to save a group of kids who could endanger a bear. How the Westerners view this 
            spiritual landmark is a movie set for people of Hollywood and as a place to get a good rock climb in. This is another 
            example of how there is a huge disconnect between the Natives and Western people. Because the Americans sued the park 
            owners who tried to prevent people from climbing and walking around the place in June. This causes a conflict among the 
            Natives and Western people because the Natives see it as a very 
            spiritual place where they have their ceremonies while Americans believe rock climbing is their way to spiritual happiness. 
            Another key point that shows the divide between Natives and Westerners is through religion. 

        </p>

         <p>
            The Western thinking of religion is a practice in a church setting in a controlled environment. 
            In other words, they don't believe it's practiced in nature. Some Westerners see it as offensive compared to Natives. 
            To answer the question thinking of religion which Indigenous ecology and resource extraction for development and profit. 
            The film shows examples of how they used this sacred place to earn a profit.
             For example, being the Westerners turned the lodge of a bear into an attraction for people to see and use.
              Which the Native people see as disrespect. 
              Other examples of people using the mountain for their own use are shown in a mining company that was trying to mine through the 
              mountain. But people paying them million dollars to stop it was on government protection. The next example that shows capitalism 
              greed is seen in the film The Snowbowl Effect. The quote is that “the San Francisco peaks are a sacred place and in 1969 a 
              proposal to develop a full-scale ski resort with shops, restaurants and lodges ignited strong community and tribal opposition” 
              (Benally). This plan into action shows the indigenous ecology and resource extraction for development and profit. 
              They wanted to turn the peaks into a ski resort area that’s been sacred for hundreds of years to the Native people. 
              This caused a huge battle between the Natives and the American people. Despite the Native American displacement 
              towards the construction of the Snowbowl it was created. A quote from the film stated, "after considering all effects, 
              the forest service prefers development because legal requirements have been meant: public sentiment favors development; 
              environmental effects are mitigated; it benefits the local economy”(Benally). 
              This was the Forest service reasoning why they were building over sacred land for profit.

        <h2>Addendum</h2>

        <p> So what I have decided to change is that I chosen Arial as my replacment  font because this 
            allows for more readabilty. The next thing I decieded to do was change the heading fonts.
            The headings use different serif fonts to create a visual hierarchy. The sizes are adjusted for emphasis and hierarchy.
            For the heading size I adjusted heading sizez for bettery hierachy to h1 which is bigger than h2. 
            for color choice sed shades of gray for text to ensure readability and reduce eye strain.
            Heading Colors Heading colors are slightly darker to maintain contrast with the background.
            For Margin and padding choice  Added a margin to the body for better spacing and readability.
            Article Max-width: Limited the width of the article for comfortable reading on larger screens.
            Heading Margin Added top margin to h2 headings for separation from the content.
            Paragraph Margin Added bottom margin to paragraphs for improved spacing between content. <em> for italicized text...</p>
